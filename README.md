# Racing Game

Welcome to Hungry, Hungry Eyeballs: The Game! The goal of this project is to practice using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap to create an interactive racing game for at least two players. My game concept centers around two sprites: a pink winged eyeball gif and a jiggling green eyeball gif. These sprites move forward across the board using the .keydown() method in jQuery; "z" to move the pink eyeball, "m" to move the green eyeball.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript + jQuery
* Bootstrap

## Existing Features

* Move player forward using "z" and "m" keys
* Responsive message in red near the top of the page that changes during three stages: page-load, game in play, and win/tie
* Reset button that positions the players back at square one

## Planned Features

* A functional WIN (and tie) function!
* Countdown button, that when clicked pops up a countdown that says "3...2...1...Go!". Before the button is clicked, and the countdown completes, neither player would be able to move their player forward.
* On page load: Players enter their screen names which appear in the table, replacing "winged eyeball" and "jiggling eyeball" text.
* A stopwatch that starts when the first player key is pressed, that continues until the first player reaches the finish line.
* A high score table below the game, or as a pop up modal you can easily view and close at any point. Would include player name (input by them), their time to reach the end.
* Ability to add a total of four players, integrated into all functionality listed above.
* Upon page load, ability for players to choose from a selection of sprite gif eyeballs.
